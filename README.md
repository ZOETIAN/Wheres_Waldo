Made in MC Lab - for those sleepless nigths @jw4js


[ Game Rule ]

Double click to confirm the area. If correct, enter the next level.

There are only four levels, if memory serves.

[ Troubles we ran into ]

- Scale properly on diff screen sizes
- Change game levels, i.e change the game background
- Hide the game background, avoid smart users open console and see complete background images

[ Original idea ]

- users with diff devices select the correct area of Waldo's face, use ratio, ori_wal_face / ori_back_img = usr_image / usr_device_size; then.... firefox doesn't support this. // I strongly suspect it's b.c. my brother closed his js on browser =.= ....

[ Changed ]

- classic front-end - solved by Canvas
- css
- backend magic (;

[ Improvement ] // Todo that never happens Orz

- seems like a good place to put the never-will-happen-TODOs
- opening scene and player guides
- transition animations among levels
- ending hints
- timer and scores counter
- more background music
- .....
- more time and love
